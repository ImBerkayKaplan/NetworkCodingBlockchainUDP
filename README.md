# NetworkCodingBlockchainUDP

This is a draft of the blockchain we intend to build on a set of Raspberry Pis, and it creates a superficial blockchain network on localhost by using different port numbers. Our goal is to use an approach we developed to increase the efficiency of the consensus protocol of permissioned blockchain (PBC) in IoT settings in terms of execution time and outgoing traffic size. Our approach uses techniques such as network coding, and we attempted to use a network coding library named "NCUtils". This project will be adapted to be used on different machines rather than the localhost.

In conclusion, we proceeded with this project and published a workshop paper with our findings. The paper can be found at https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3286984. We compared our approach with PBC implemented using TCP protocol.

## Make file will be coming soon
